### Modified VIPER Architecture

[VIPER][ref1] is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers. You can read more about it in the link above.

This version is a slightly modified and more simplified version of VIPER architecture.
